Maintaining an accurate list of your contacts is a fundamental requirement for running a successful business. 
Without these details how would you be able to chase up outstanding customer invoices or be able to contact your 
suppliers for more stock. How would your sales team be able to contact repeat or potential customers? how would you 
keep the contacts of your friends and family? What happens if you lose your phone or those handwritten notes?   

DFCorp's Digital AddressBook is designed to address this problem. This slim factor console program won't hog your 
resources like other solutions, it will allow you to store your contacts and then search for a specific contact, or 
display them all for your own use. It's editing features will allow you to add contacts, delete contacts and edit those 
details as you require. The contacts can be sorted by name, email address and phone number.

what's more, the search feature will also allow you to search for partial contacts and display all that meet those
