Maintaining an accurate list of your contacts is a fundamental requirement for running a successful business. 
Without these details how would you be able to chase up outstanding customer invoices or be able to contact your 
suppliers for more stock. How would your sales team be able to contact repeat or potential customers? how would you 
keep the contacts of your friends and family? What happens if you lose your phone or those handwritten notes?

other solutions, it will allow you to store your contacts and then search for a specific contact, or display them all
