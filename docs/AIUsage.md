## AI usage in core features

ChatGPT was used to get the necessary text to add mockito to the project as it wasn't showing on the list of generatable
dependencies. The code offered was out of date though, and replaced with code from mvnrepository.com


Used to confirm there wasn't a better way to clear the screen then System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J");
System.out.flush();



me: if i passed an ArrayList into another class, is there any way to stop that class being able to change the data of that arraylist?

chatgpt:     Pass an Unmodifiable List: Instead of passing the original ArrayList, you can pass an unmodifiable view of the list using Collections.unmodifiableList() method. This prevents the other class from modifying the list.

java

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ArrayList<String> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
originalList.add("Item 1");
originalList.add("Item 2");

        OtherClass otherClass = new OtherClass(Collections.unmodifiableList(originalList));
        // Attempt to modify the list in the other class
        // otherClass.modifyList(); // This will throw UnsupportedOperationException
    }
}

class OtherClass {
private List<String> readOnlyList;

    public OtherClass(List<String> readOnlyList) {
        this.readOnlyList = readOnlyList;
    }
    
    public void modifyList() {
        // Attempting to modify the list will throw UnsupportedOperationException
        readOnlyList.add("New Item");
    }
}

    Defensive Copy: Instead of passing the original ArrayList, pass a copy of it to the other class. This way, any modifications made in the other class won't affect the original list.

java

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ArrayList<String> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
originalList.add("Item 1");
originalList.add("Item 2");

        OtherClass otherClass = new OtherClass(new ArrayList<>(originalList));
        // Modifications in otherClass won't affect originalList
        // otherClass.modifyList(); // You can safely call this
    }
}

class OtherClass {
private ArrayList<String> internalList;

    public OtherClass(ArrayList<String> list) {
        this.internalList = list;
    }
    
    public void modifyList() {
        // You can modify the list here
        internalList.add("New Item");
    }
}

Both approaches have their pros and cons. Using an unmodifiable list is safer but if you need to modify the list within the original class, defensive copying might be more suitable. Choose the approach based on your specific requirements.

I went with the defensive programming technique and modified addressbook to return a new arraylist made up on the contacts instead of directly returning the contacts list


# Additional Features
## Prompt:
i've written a program which meets these requirements: The user should be able to add a contact to the address book
A contact should have at least a name, phone number and email address
The user should be able to search for a contact by name and have the results displayed
The user should be able to remove a contact from the address book
The user should be able to edit a contact's details
Duplicate phone numbers or email addresses should not be allowed, i.e. no two contacts should have the same phone number or email address

Thank you.

You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your project!


## prompt:
a contact is a class made up of 3 properties, name, phone number and emaill address. Addressbook is a class which contains a arraylist of Contact and the methods to add and search through contacts. I want to create a method which will sort that arraylist inalphabetical order by name, what is the best practice method to do this in Java?

## Response:

To sort an ArrayList of `Contact` objects alphabetically by name in Java, you can use the `sort` method from the `Collections` class along with a custom `Comparator`. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Define the `Contact` class** with the properties `name`, `phoneNumber`, and `emailAddress`.
2. **Define the `AddressBook` class** with an `ArrayList<Contact>` and the method to sort the contacts.

Here's a complete example demonstrating this:

### Contact Class
```java
public class Contact {
    private String name;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private String emailAddress;

    public Contact(String name, String phoneNumber, String emailAddress) {
        this.name = name;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.emailAddress = emailAddress;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getPhoneNumber() {
        return phoneNumber;
    }

    public String getEmailAddress() {
        return emailAddress;
    }

    // Optional: Override toString() for easy display of contact details
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Contact{name='" + name + "', phoneNumber='" + phoneNumber + "', emailAddress='" + emailAddress + "'}";
    }
}
```

### AddressBook Class
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class AddressBook {
    private ArrayList<Contact> contacts;

    public AddressBook() {
        contacts = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Method to add a contact
    public void addContact(Contact contact) {
        contacts.add(contact);
    }

    // Method to sort contacts alphabetically by name
    public void sortContactsByName() {
        Collections.sort(contacts, new Comparator<Contact>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Contact c1, Contact c2) {
                return c1.getName().compareToIgnoreCase(c2.getName());
            }
        });
    }

    // Method to display all contacts
    public void displayContacts() {
        for (Contact contact : contacts) {
            System.out.println(contact);
        }
    }

    // Main method for demonstration
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AddressBook addressBook = new AddressBook();

        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Alice", "1234567890", "alice@example.com"));
        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Charlie", "0987654321", "charlie@example.com"));
        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Bob", "5555555555", "bob@example.com"));

        System.out.println("Contacts before sorting:");
        addressBook.displayContacts();

        addressBook.sortContactsByName();

        System.out.println("\nContacts after sorting:");
        addressBook.displayContacts();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Contact Class**:
    - This class has three properties: `name`, `phoneNumber`, and `emailAddress`.
    - It includes a constructor to initialize these properties.
    - Getters are provided to access the properties.
    - The `toString` method is overridden for easy display of contact details.

2. **AddressBook Class**:
    - This class contains an `ArrayList<Contact>` to store the contacts.
    - The `addContact` method allows adding new contacts to the address book.
    - The `sortContactsByName` method sorts the contacts alphabetically by name using `Collections.sort` and a custom `Comparator`.
    - The `displayContacts` method prints out all contacts.
    - The `main` method demonstrates adding contacts, displaying them before and after sorting.

### Sorting Logic
- The `Comparator<Contact>` is used in the `sortContactsByName` method to compare `Contact` objects based on their `name` property.
- The `compareToIgnoreCase` method ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This approach follows best practices by using the built-in sorting functionality provided by the `Collections` class and ensures that the contacts are sorted efficiently and correctly.

## Prompt:

in c# I would use something like listobject.sort(a =>a.getName()) is this the equivilent?

## response:

In Java, the equivalent to C#'s `listObject.Sort(a => a.getName())` is to use the `sort` method with a lambda expression. Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and method references, which can simplify the sorting process. Here's how you can achieve the same functionality in Java:

### Using Lambda Expressions

### Contact Class
This remains the same as before:
```java
public class Contact {
    private String name;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private String emailAddress;

    public Contact(String name, String phoneNumber, String emailAddress) {
        this.name = name;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        this.emailAddress = emailAddress;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getPhoneNumber() {
        return phoneNumber;
    }

    public String getEmailAddress() {
        return emailAddress;
    }

    // Optional: Override toString() for easy display of contact details
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Contact{name='" + name + "', phoneNumber='" + phoneNumber + "', emailAddress='" + emailAddress + "'}";
    }
}
```

### AddressBook Class with Lambda Expressions
You can simplify the sorting method by using a lambda expression:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class AddressBook {
    private ArrayList<Contact> contacts;

    public AddressBook() {
        contacts = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Method to add a contact
    public void addContact(Contact contact) {
        contacts.add(contact);
    }

    // Method to sort contacts alphabetically by name using lambda expression
    public void sortContactsByName() {
        contacts.sort((Contact c1, Contact c2) -> c1.getName().compareToIgnoreCase(c2.getName()));
    }

    // Alternatively, using method reference
    public void sortContactsByNameMethodRef() {
        contacts.sort(Comparator.comparing(Contact::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER));
    }

    // Method to display all contacts
    public void displayContacts() {
        for (Contact contact : contacts) {
            System.out.println(contact);
        }
    }

    // Main method for demonstration
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AddressBook addressBook = new AddressBook();

        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Alice", "1234567890", "alice@example.com"));
        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Charlie", "0987654321", "charlie@example.com"));
        addressBook.addContact(new Contact("Bob", "5555555555", "bob@example.com"));

        System.out.println("Contacts before sorting:");
        addressBook.displayContacts();

        addressBook.sortContactsByName(); // Using lambda expression
        // addressBook.sortContactsByNameMethodRef(); // Using method reference

        System.out.println("\nContacts after sorting:");
        addressBook.displayContacts();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Lambda Expression:** `contacts.sort((Contact c1, Contact c2) -> c1.getName().compareToIgnoreCase(c2.getName()))`
    - This lambda expression directly implements the comparison logic within the `sort` method, comparing the names of two `Contact` objects in a case-insensitive manner.

- **Method Reference:** `contacts.sort(Comparator.comparing(Contact::getName, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER))`
    - This approach uses `Comparator.comparing` with a method reference to `Contact::getName` and specifies `String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER` for case-insensitive comparison. It's more concise and leverages built-in comparator utilities.

Both approaches achieve the same result, sorting the contacts alphabetically by name in a case-insensitive manner, similar to the C# example you provided. The choice between them can be based on your preference for lambda expressions or method references for readability and conciseness.

## Prompt:

when using mockito i'm getting this error: reason: no instance(s) of type variable(s) T exist so that void conforms to T

## Response: 

The error you're encountering, "no instance(s) of type variable(s) T exist so that void conforms to T," typically occurs when you are trying to use Mockito to mock or stub a method that has a generic return type. This often happens because of how generics and type inference work in Java.

Here are a few potential causes and solutions to this issue:

### 1. Mocking a Generic Method

If you are trying to mock a method that returns a generic type, you need to specify the generic type explicitly. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public <T> T doSomething() {
        // Implementation here
        return null;
    }
}
```

When mocking such a method, you should provide a concrete type for the generic return type:

```java
MyClass myClassMock = mock(MyClass.class);
when(myClassMock.<String>doSomething()).thenReturn("Hello");
```

### 2. Using `ArgumentCaptor` with Generics

If you are using `ArgumentCaptor` with generics, you need to specify the type correctly. For instance:

```java
ArgumentCaptor<List<String>> captor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass((Class) List.class);
verify(myClassMock).someMethod(captor.capture());
List<String> capturedArgument = captor.getValue();
```

### 3. Ensuring Type Safety with `any()`

When using matchers like `any()`, make sure you specify the type explicitly to avoid type safety issues:

```java
when(myClassMock.doSomething(any(String.class))).thenReturn("Hello");
```

### Example Code

Let's consider an example where you might be seeing this error:

```java
public class MyService {
    public <T> T process(T input) {
        // Implementation here
        return input;
    }
}

// In your test
MyService myServiceMock = mock(MyService.class);
when(myServiceMock.process(any())).thenReturn("Processed");
```

This would result in the error you mentioned. To fix it, you need to provide type information:

```java
when(myServiceMock.<String>process(any(String.class))).thenReturn("Processed");
```

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example to illustrate how to avoid this issue:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyServiceTest {

    public class MyService {
        public <T> T process(T input) {
            return input;
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testProcess() {
        MyService myServiceMock = mock(MyService.class);

        // Specify the generic type explicitly
        when(myServiceMock.<String>process(any(String.class))).thenReturn("Processed");

        String result = myServiceMock.process("Input");
        assertEquals("Processed", result);
    }
}
```

By explicitly specifying the type parameter, you help the compiler understand how to handle the generics, thus avoiding the type inference issue.

### Summary

The key to resolving this issue is ensuring that you provide the necessary type information when mocking or stubbing generic methods. By specifying the type explicitly, you can guide the compiler to correctly infer the types and avoid the mentioned error.

## Prompt: 

I want to record if a void method has been called, what is the best way to do this using mockito?

Yes, you can combine `assertAll` with `verify` when using JUnit and Mockito. The `assertAll` method, which is part of JUnit 5, allows you to group multiple assertions together so that all assertions are executed, and any failures are reported collectively.

Here's an example to illustrate how you can use `assertAll` in combination with Mockito's `verify` to perform multiple verifications in a single test case.

### Example

#### MyClass.java

```java
public class MyClass {
    public void method1() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    public void method2() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    public void method3() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

#### MyClassTest.java

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable;

public class MyClassTest {

    @Test
    public void testMultipleMethodCalls() {
        MyClass myClassMock = mock(MyClass.class);

        // Call the methods on the mock
        myClassMock.method1();
        myClassMock.method2();
        myClassMock.method3();

        // Combine assertAll with verify
        assertAll(
            new Executable() {
                @Override
                public void execute() throws Throwable {
                    verify(myClassMock).method1();
                }
            },
            new Executable() {
                @Override
                public void execute() throws Throwable {
                    verify(myClassMock).method2();
                }
            },
            new Executable() {
                @Override
                public void execute() throws Throwable {
                    verify(myClassMock).method3();
                }
            }
        );
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Mock Creation**: Create a mock instance of `MyClass`.
2. **Method Calls**: Invoke the methods on the mock instance.
3. **Assertions with `assertAll`**:
    - Use `assertAll` to group multiple assertions together.
    - Each `Executable` in `assertAll` verifies that a specific method was called on the mock instance.
    - If any of the verifications fail, all failures will be reported together at the end of the test.

This approach ensures that you can perform multiple verifications in a single test method and see all verification failures collectively, which can be helpful for debugging.

### Simplified Lambda Syntax

For a more concise and modern approach, you can use lambda expressions with `assertAll`:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest {

    @Test
    public void testMultipleMethodCalls() {
        MyClass myClassMock = mock(MyClass.class);

        // Call the methods on the mock
        myClassMock.method1();
        myClassMock.method2();
        myClassMock.method3();

        // Combine assertAll with verify using lambdas
        assertAll(
            () -> verify(myClassMock).method1(),
            () -> verify(myClassMock).method2(),
            () -> verify(myClassMock).method3()
        );
    }
}
```

Using lambda expressions simplifies the syntax and makes the test more readable. Each lambda expression in `assertAll` performs a `verify` call to check that the corresponding method was invoked on the mock object.


## Prompt:

uing mockito in java, I want to create a spy object of a class

## Response:

Creating a spy object in Mockito allows you to create a partial mock, which means you can mock certain methods of the object while allowing others to behave as they normally would. This can be useful when you want to mock part of the behavior while still using the real implementation of other methods.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating and using a spy object in Mockito:

### Step 1: Add Mockito to Your Project

First, ensure you have Mockito included in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:3.9.0'
```

### Step 2: Create a Spy Object

To create a spy object, you use the `spy` method provided by Mockito. Here’s an example:

#### MyClass.java

```java
public class MyClass {
    public String method1() {
        return "Real Method1";
    }

    public String method2() {
        return "Real Method2";
    }
}
```

#### MyClassTest.java

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest {

    @Test
    public void testSpy() {
        // Create an instance of the real object
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();

        // Create a spy object
        MyClass spyMyClass = spy(myClass);

        // Stub the method2() to return a different value
        when(spyMyClass.method2()).thenReturn("Mocked Method2");

        // Verify that method1() returns the real value
        assertEquals("Real Method1", spyMyClass.method1());

        // Verify that method2() returns the mocked value
        assertEquals("Mocked Method2", spyMyClass.method2());

        // Verify that method1() was called
        verify(spyMyClass).method1();

        // Verify that method2() was called
        verify(spyMyClass).method2();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Create an Instance of the Real Object**: First, create an instance of the real object that you want to spy on.

    ```java
    MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
    ```

2. **Create a Spy Object**: Use the `spy` method to create a spy object of the real instance.

    ```java
    MyClass spyMyClass = spy(myClass);
    ```

3. **Stub a Method**: Stub the method you want to mock. In this example, we stub `method2` to return "Mocked Method2".

    ```java
    when(spyMyClass.method2()).thenReturn("Mocked Method2");
    ```

4. **Call Methods and Verify Behavior**:
    - Call `method1` on the spy object and verify that it returns the real implementation's value.
    - Call `method2` on the spy object and verify that it returns the mocked value.
    - Use `verify` to check that the methods were called.

    ```java
    assertEquals("Real Method1", spyMyClass.method1());
    assertEquals("Mocked Method2", spyMyClass.method2());
    verify(spyMyClass).method1();
    verify(spyMyClass).method2();
    ```

### Important Considerations

- **Partial Mocking**: Spies are meant for partial mocking. Use them when you want to mock some methods but not others.
- **Real Method Invocation**: By default, a spy will call the real methods unless they are stubbed.
- **Avoid Overusing Spies**: Overusing spies can lead to fragile tests that are closely tied to the implementation details of the class under test. Use spies judiciously.

By following this guide, you can effectively create and use spy objects in Mockito to test your Java code.
