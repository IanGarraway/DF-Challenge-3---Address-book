## Introduction

After the resounding success of the Secret Diary, DFCorp are now looking to extend their range of products and have decided to create an Address Book application.  The address book will allow users to access an independent application to store their contacts in.

> Before proceeding, ensure that you have a solid understanding of why the customer needs this software and the benefits that it will bring to them (See Task 1)

### Core Features

The Business Analyst team, working with the client has identified the following features that should be implemented in the first release of the application:

- The user should be able to add a contact to the address book
  - A contact should have at least a name, phone number and email address
- The user should be able to search for a contact by name and have the results displayed
- The user should be able to remove a contact from the address book
- The user should be able to edit a contact's details
- Duplicate phone numbers or email addresses should not be allowed, i.e. no two contacts should have the same phone number or email address
- The user should be able to view all contacts in the address book
- The user should be using a console interface to interact with the application

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to complete tasks relating to the specific requirements above is NOT allowed.  All work here should be your own.

### Additional Features

In addition to these core features, the client has the following requests for functionality that they would like to see in the application if you have time:

- The user should be able to search for a contact by phone number and have the results displayed
- The user should be able to search for a contact by email address and have the results displayed
- The user should be able to search for a contact by name, phone number or email address and have the results displayed in alphabetical order
- The user should be able to delete all contacts at once, confirming that they want to do this before proceeding

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to help complete tasks relating to these further requirements is allowed but should be clearly documented.

---

## Tasks

1. Explain why the customer needs this software and the benefits that it will bring to them.  You should include the following in your explanation:
   - The problem that the software will solve
   - The benefits that the software will bring to the user
   - The impact that the software will have on the customer's business
2. From the requirements listed above, create user stories that break the functionality required down
3. From the user stories, create domain models and/or class diagrams for the core features of the application.  You should include the following in your domain models:
   - The classes that you will need to create
   - The data types of each attribute
   - The access modifiers of each attribute and method
   - The return types of each method
   - The relationships between the classes
4. Using a test-driven approach, implement the core features of the application.
5. Create a program that will put some contacts in the application, run in the console and take the user's input to navigate a menu to use the features

---

## Acceptance Criteria

DFCorp has requested that the following criteria are met:

- The application meets at least the core features listed above
- - The application is able to be run through the console and the user is able to navigate the menu
- The domain models and/or class diagrams are clearly documented and show the relationships between the classes
- The application is tested using a test-driven approach
- The code is written clean and uses appropriate conventions found in Java

---

## Tips

- Commit regularly to GitHub with clear commit messages - write a failing test, pass the test, commit, etc
- You should put your domain models and test plans in the markdown file in the `docs` folder, if you decide to use some form of Kanban board to track your progress, you should include a screenshot of this in the markdown file
- You should use the [Java Coding Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html) when writing your code
- You should use the [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) testing framework to test your code with any additional libraries you feel are necessary (e.g. Mockito, coverage tools, etc)
- Your source code should go into the `src` folder and follow an appropriate package structure
- Your test code should go into the `test` folder and follow an appropriate package structure
- Add comments to your code to document its intent where necessary

## Submission

Your Challenge attempt should be submitted via commits to the forked project from GitHub Classroom.  Your trainer will have supplied you with the appropriate link to do access this, you need to take no further action on this platform.  To indicate that you have completed the Challenge, you should you the Assignment Submission link in the Challenge course for your Cohort on Noodle.  The Progression Management Frameworks will be assessed via a marking rubric in Noodle and you will be able to see how you performed in each competency.

You are not permitted to collaborate with anyone to complete this challenge.  You should complete the *Core Functionality* using traditional skills, knowledge and understanding of software engineering and all code submitted for this should be your own.  You may use a *Generative AI tool* to help you complete the *Additional Functionality* but this should be clearly documented.

---

## Feedback

After submission of your challenge attempt, your trainer will record and submit feedback in Noodle and/or via GitHub for comments in your code .  You will then be able to view this feedback via Noodle and your GitHub account.

Your trainer will also provide general feedback to the cohort via the Discord channel.
